          offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host
          Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Peerbuds

          (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or
          accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the
          performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Peerbuds does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services.
          Any references to a Member being &quot;verified&quot; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed
          a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement,
          certification or guarantee by Peerbuds about any Member, including of the Member&#39;s identity or background or
          whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding
          whether to participate in an Experience, participate in an online community, do live peer-to-peer sessions, interactive
          online class, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as
          defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph
          was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by Peerbuds of any Host or Listing.</span>

          of Peerbuds for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf,

          Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements.
          To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole
          or in part, into other languages. Peerbuds cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members
          are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The Peerbuds Platform may contain
          translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied,
          including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for

          areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers,
          or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Peerbuds Platform. Peerbuds

          permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government
          identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds
          of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service
          providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records

      <p class="c1">
        <span class="c4 c3">17.1 Unless you reside in the EU, you acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire
          risk arising out of your access to and use of the Peerbuds Platform and Collective Content, your publishing or
          booking of any Listing via the Peerbuds Platform, your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience
          or use of any other Host Service or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online
          remains with you. Neither Peerbuds nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Peerbuds
          Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages,
          including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure
          or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress
          arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the Peerbuds Platform
          or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons
          with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the Peerbuds Platform, or (iv) from
          your publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of a Listing&rsquo;s Host Services, whether
          based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether
          or not Peerbuds has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein
          is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Hosts
          pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the Peerbuds Host Guarantee, in no event will Peerbuds&rsquo;s
          aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Peerbuds Platform including,
          but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the Peerbuds Platform, or from the use
          of or inability to use the Peerbuds Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Accommodation, Experiences,
          Event or other Host Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for
          bookings via the Peerbuds Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to
          the liability, or if you are a Host, t</span>
        <span class="c2 c4">he amounts paid by Peerbuds to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability,
          or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. </span>
        <span class="c13 c4 c3">The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Peerbuds
          and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
          damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect
          Peerbud&rsquo;s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation,
          misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable
          law.
