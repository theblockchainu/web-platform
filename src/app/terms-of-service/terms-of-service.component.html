For example, if you begin a paid subscription on January 1st for a 14 day free trial, you will be charged on January 15th for the first month, February 15th for the second month, and so on. Your billing data may vary slightly if your billing date does not have a corresponding date the next month (i.e. enrollment started on January 31 will be billed on February 28). Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Peerbuds does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription.

For subscription products or services, you may cancel at any time by going to your account settings.

You may cancel at any time by going to your account settings. If you cancel your subscription during a free trial period, no charges will be made against your Payment Method. You may be ineligible for certain features of a product or service during your free trial period. For example, you cannot be awarded a Verified Certificate or similar certification during your free trial period because you must pay for at least one (1) month of a course subscription to be eligible for a Verified Certificate in that course, or must pay for no less than two (2) months of Online Courses, in the case of a Nanodegree.
