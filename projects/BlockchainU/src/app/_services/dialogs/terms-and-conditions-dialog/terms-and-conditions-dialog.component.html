          performance or conduct of any Member or third party. The Blockchain University does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services.
          Any references to a Member being &quot;verified&quot; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed
          a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement,
          certification or guarantee by The Blockchain University about any Member, including of the Member&#39;s identity or background or
          whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding
          whether to participate in a Workshop, participate in an online community, do live peer-to-peer sessions, interactive
